# n4n0 theme base

These are the base files needed for wordpress to register a theme and the basics that I have been using to start working on a WordPress theme for the last few years.

No html elements, except for the basic html wrap, you will see a blank page, after installing.

This exists only for the purpose of not having to create all of these basic files and functionality every time I start writing a new theme from "scratch".

## Features include

* LESS processing on each reload for admins, if the less file is newer.
* handy functions like
** login username hiding (does not show the user doesn't exist message on failed login)
** enables menus and post thumbnails
** modifies excerpt from [] to ...
** includes a decent reset file and enforces border-box box sizing upon all elements
